# Converstion Notes

The foreword is technically a preface, as a foreword is written by someone other than the author.

It would look more cosmetically appealing perhaps if curly quotes were used rather than straight quotes.

The PDF's paragraph alignment in Chapter 4 "It is natural for creatures to identify..." is should be unindented to match the typesetting of the rest of the book. I have left it unindented for this reason.

Superscripted the "20th" in chapter 9 for consistency.

Finished paragraph checking upto Chapter 13.
