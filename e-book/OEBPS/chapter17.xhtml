		<p class="noindent top">The Western heart is not just Western man's love for his family and his folk, but it encompasses something much more important. The Western heart stems from Western man's love for his people and it is what drives Western man to protect those people at all costs. The Western heart can be summed up quite simply as Western man's courage and bravery, which are the traits that allow Western man to go that step further when necessary to defend his blood and soil. The Western heart has been a major contributing factor in the development of Western civilisation.</p>
		<p>History books are full of the tales of Western heart, bravery and courage. This bravery and courage allowed Western man to stand strong even in the face of overwhelming odds; it allowed Western man to undertake great challenges even when the risk of failure or death was high, and it ensured that Western man protected his loved ones and community at any cost. The Western heart was the heart of a warrior, an explorer and a pioneer. The Western heart drove Western civilisation forward and protected that civilisation from those who wished to tear it down.</p>
		<p>There are many examples of Western heart throughout the illustrious history of Western civilisation and even from the earliest recorded history these acts of courage can be seen – the Battle of Thermopylae is a perfect example. Three hundred brave Spartan warriors and a small group of allies were vastly outnumbered by the Persian army, yet despite the odds being heavily stacked against them, the courage and the bravery of the Spartans went down in history as they broke the spirit of the Persian invaders. Despite the Spartans ultimately perishing, their actions bought the Greek nations enough time to rally and eventually defeat the Persian Empire.</p>
		<p>The Battle of Vienna is another great example of Western bravery and courage. Again Western man found himself outnumbered five to one against the vast forces of the Ottoman Empire. This battle was a decisive one and marked the turning point in the Ottoman-Habsburg wars, a three hundred-year struggle between the Holy Roman and Ottoman empires. This great victory led to the collapse of the Turkish occupation of Eastern Europe and allowed Western man to regain control over his homeland.</p>
