<title>11: The Role of Feminism – The Reduction of the Western Birth Rate</title>

		<p class="noindent top">Feminism is an attack on the West, a divisive ideology that seeks to turn women against men and break the natural loving bonds that exist between males and females. The complementary pairing of man and woman has served the West well and literally built Western civilisation through mutual support and the growth of the nuclear family.</p>
		<p>Feminism does not only attack the male, but it also attacks the female. In order to allow the female to unnaturally compete with the male, and in order to achieve a sense of false equality, the female must alter her behaviour and adopt increasingly masculine traits. The female must lose her femininity, her loving, caring and nurturing side and must become hardened to her natural motherly and homely instincts. This represents the loss of one of the two components that is vital to the upbringing of a healthy and developed child – the loving mother.</p> <p>Feminism also demonises the male. Feminism propagates lies of a 'patriarchy' and 'rape culture' in order to make women distrust and even hate men. These beliefs set up a false dichotomy of the male being the slave master and abuser and of the female being the slave and the victim. This ideology of hate turns the woman away from her natural partner, lover and friend and creates an air of distrust between women and men. Trust however is the obvious foundation of any loving relationship, so with distrust and hate and a growing manufactured and false battle between the sexes, the big casualty is lasting relationships, marriage and the nuclear family.</p>
		<p>Women no longer want to be loving mothers, instead choosing to follow a path where they favour competing with males in the workplace rather than having children. It is not enough that women increasingly want to compete with males and become like males – thus having less children, but it is now a sad fact that women see children as a barrier to achieving their goals and see motherhood as wholly undesirable and something that holds them back.</p>
		<p>For the feminist, being a mother is not an honourable pursuit – it simply makes the woman a slave to her male counterpart and ties her to him. Children are no longer desirable; they are a drain on time, resources and money. Children have gone from being a natural and fulfilling addition to a woman's life to being simply baggage that slows a woman down in her race to achieve material goals.</p>
		<p>This is a key facet of the destruction of the Western soul and
spirituality that the enemies of the West seek. The warm happiness
and spiritual fulfilment that a loving couple gain from raising a
family is replaced by individuals seeking greater material wealth.
Material goals are put before everything, and the spiritual and
soulful desires that brought loving couples together to procreate are
now seen as a barrier to the new false idol to which Western people
dedicate their life – materialism.
The rise of the notion that a child is no longer desirable and
in fact holds a woman back has obviously affected the Western birth
rate in a dramatic way. But it is not enough that women decide to
simply not have children by avoiding loving relationships and
marriage. Women now decide to kill their unborn children in order
to forgo motherhood and continue down a path of personal gain
and materialistic pursuits.
The West has witnessed the meteoric rise of abortion. We
have talked earlier about the id and its selfish drive for pleasure
and satisfaction and the superego and its drive for moral duty,
values and selfless commitment to one's family and the larger
community. Having a child and caring for and nurturing the next
generation of one's people is the most selfless and noble act for a
young woman to undertake.
Abortion is the most selfish and immoral act; to abort a
healthy child – essentially to kill your unborn baby in an effort to
ensure your own selfish and materialistic gain – is the single most
unnatural thing a woman can do. The overwhelming natural
