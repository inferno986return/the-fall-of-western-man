		<p class="noindent top">The two most natural instincts any creature possesses are the will to survive and the wish to reproduce. People often ask; 'what is the meaning of life?' Fundamentally the meaning of life is life itself – and that truth is expressed in the will of an individual to both survive and procreate. In the simplest terms, a successful organism attempts to prolong its own life for as long as possible and during that life seeks to reproduce and ensure its offspring survives to maturity.</p>
		<p>Throughout the history of this planet the strongest, the best adapted to survive and those with a natural advantage over others have lived longer. The longer an organism lives, the more chances it will have to procreate and pass on its genes to the next generation ensuring that ultimately the organism lives on after death through future generations of its offspring.</p>
		<p>This has led to natural selection and the slow improvement of the gene pool over time. The weaker individuals in any group died more readily and at a younger age, hence they were less likely to pass on their genetic code and the weaknesses within it. The strong survived longer and were more likely to pass on their genetic material. Hence, over time, weak traits and characteristics were likely to be bred out of a group and strong traits and characteristics were likely to become more prevalent within the group and over time those traits would improve further and become progressively stronger.</p>
		<p>Over tens of thousands of years this slow and arduous process has led to many incremental changes and improvements and Western man has changed and developed to become what he is today. Two of the most unique traits of Western man are his ability to reason and his inventive spirit. These traits are surely a consequence of living in such harsh conditions during Western man's early development in Northern Europe.</p>
		<p>If early Western man was not hard-working, tenacious and inventive he would have perished in the harsh winters as he would have either frozen or run out of food and starved to death. These conditions meant only the best managed to survive and went on to pass down their genetics which in turn improved the gene pool – this was the very beginning of Western civilisation. This same inventive and creative edge went on to give the world electricity, the combustion engine, great works of architecture as well as artistic and cultural masterpieces.</p>
