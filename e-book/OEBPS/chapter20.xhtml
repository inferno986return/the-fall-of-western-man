		<p class="noindent top">The death of the Western superego precedes the fall of Western man and the destruction of Western civilisation itself. The period we are now living in can be described as the end times for Western civilisation and the next few generations of Western man will bear witness to the death of the West. The conditions for a perfect storm are now in place and in that storm the West will be washed away and consigned to the history books – if indeed history books are ever written again in the absence of Western man.</p>
		<p>The death of the West will not come about in one magnificent yet tragic final battle that eclipses all others that have gone before it. The death of the West will not occur in some 'race war' or in a series of great conflicts where battle lines are clearly drawn and armies clash in a final epic military engagement. The death of the West will be a creeping one – like a cancer that eats away at an organism, slowly weakening the suffering creature over a long period of time. The death of the West will be akin to a death of a thousand cuts rather than one significant blow.</p>
		<p>Many have theorised that eventually immigrants that have come to settle in the West and whose communities have grown in size will one day turn on Western man – that foreign communities will form a fifth column within the West and initiate a great conflict on Western soil. This theory surmises a racial or religious conflict on a grand scale between Western man and those immigrants who have come to settle in the West yet retained a culture that is hostile to that of Western culture.</p>
		<p>This theory of a great war is not only misguided, but is also highly damaging to the cause of saving Western man. It relies on the idea that Western man is who he once was and that he still has his mind, body, soul and heart intact. The idea of a great racial or religious war – and one where Western man would be victorious – is actually laughable. This war will never take place, but instead the death of the West will take place house by house, street by street, town by town and city by city, like a creeping shroud falling over Western nations.</p>
		<p>Let's stop for one minute and actually analyse the theory behind the idea of a racial or religious conflict on the level some theorise – what's more, let's look at the likely outcome if such a war was to take place. For a giant conflict to engulf a nation, battle lines must first form and for this to occur different homogenous groups must exist. Homogenous groups form based on common bonds between the people who make up those groups.</p>
		<p>Therein lies the first major problem with the idea of a racial or religious war – whilst the different cultures and races that have emigrated to the West have retained their group consciousness, Western man has not. If there was a racial or religious conflict the individuals within homogenous communities would come together to protect their own community, but sadly Western man would be unlikely to come together with his brothers and sisters and would be unable to form a single homogenous group. The drive for individuality and isolation that has been pushed upon Western man by the enemies of the West has robbed Western man of the common bonds that once bound Western society together.</p>
		<p>Western man no longer has the common cultural bonds, traditions and moral values that once bound him to his brothers and sisters. Western society is no longer homogenous and cohesive; Western society is a loose-knit group of individuals who no longer relate to each other. The subcultures that have sprung up and been embraced so enthusiastically by Western man have driven him into ever smaller groups which no longer relate to one another.</p>
		<p>Western man used to know his neighbours – in fact he knew everyone on his street and the streets adjacent to where he lived. He worked with his neighbours, drank with his neighbours and went to church with them. Everyone in Western society knew one another and the common bonds they shared held them together as a community. Now many Western folk don't even know the names of those who live next door to them – let alone the names of all those who live on their street. Western man's public houses have closed, his industry has been exported and his churches lay empty.</p>
		<p>This is the complete opposite of the situation that can be observed in immigrant communities that have come to settle in the West. The immigrants that have settled in Western nations have formed their own strong and close-knit communities where people know each other, where there are established community leaders who command respect, where entire families live on the same street and where everyone knows the names of their neighbours. The people in these communities look out for one another, do business with one another and worship at the same temples. These communities cherish their traditions and wish to preserve the shared heritage which was passed down by their ancestors and now acts as the glue that holds their community together.</p>
		<p>If Western man was forced to come together as a group in order to fight a fifth column within his own nation, how would he fare? The answer is clear – he would be overwhelmed. Western society is a disparate group; a weak collection of individuals – many of these individuals wouldn't even want to stand with one another as they wouldn't know each other and wouldn't be able to relate to one another. On the other hand many immigrant communities would be strong and stand as one. The implications of this do not need explaining in detail.</p>
		<p>The second main reason that Western man would not emerge victorious from a civil war based along ethnic or cultural lines is that Western man no longer holds the right priorities in life. Western man is now materialistic, individualistic and hedonistic. Not only would Western man lack the strong community and the group consciousness needed in order to stand a chance of winning a civil war, but Western man would also lack the motivation to fight, for Western man no longer sees value in anything genuinely meaningful or worthwhile.</p>
		<p>When great sacrifices are made and great acts of bravery are displayed – such as in the Battle of Vienna – the men who faced such overwhelming odds had strong beliefs that allowed them to override their instinct of individual preservation in order to serve the greater good of their people. When faced with almost certain death the natural drive – provided from the ego (reality principle) – is to flee. However a developed superego can override that instinct and the preservation of the group is put before the preservation of the individual.</p>
		<p>The great sacrifices made by Western man throughout history were indicative of his priorities in life. Western man prioritised things that made him spiritually strong – family, folk, faith and soil. Western man had deep connections to his immediate nuclear family, the community in which he lived, his religion and the land that he called home. Now Western man is disconnected from all of these things. The nuclear family has been undermined, the Western community is fractured, religion has either been watered down or forgotten and finally Western man is no longer connected to the natural world around him, instead cocooned in walls of brick and concrete where he stares mindlessly at a variety of flickering screens.</p>
		<p>Western man's priorities in life made him strong and gave him good reasons to fight, however his priorities in life have now shifted. Individualism, hedonism and materialism have become the new priorities for Western man – but all of those callings are selfish and are centred on personal pleasure and self-gratification. Feeding those pleasures are the priority, which means in times of conflict Western man would be more likely to flee with as much wealth as he could carry or hide in order to live another day in the hope of continuing to seek personal pleasure at a later date.</p>
		<p>Think back to the days of the First World War – the bloodiest and most destructive period of warfare the world has ever known. What motivated Western man to climb up out of his trenches and charge at machine-gun emplacements protected by barbed wire fences? Trench warfare is one of the most brutal types of combat the world has ever known and one that sees enormous numbers of casualties stack up very quickly; in fact offensive manoeuvres were often almost suicidal. Yet what motivated young men to 'go over the top' and face certain death? The brave men who threw themselves into barbed wire fences and were cut down by machine-gun fire were motivated by spiritual priorities which strengthened their resolve and allowed them to override their own natural survival instinct.</p>
		<p>These same spiritual callings to folk, faith and family may be lost to Western man – but that doesn't mean they are lost to the immigrant communities that have settled in Western nations. Many of the immigrant communities living in the Western world still form strong families, have lower divorce rates, attend religious institutions regularly and as stated earlier are part of a tight-knit community. These higher spiritual priorities are what motivate people to fight bravely.</p>
		<p>The enemies of the West have stripped Western man of his spirituality and damaged the Western soul – replacing Western man's natural callings with warped false idols. But the immigrant communities that have flooded the West have retained their spiritual callings and have continued to prioritise the right things in life. As such if a conflict ever arose, Western man would not be fighting with the fervour of his enemies, but simply trying to live another day in order to carry on his pursuit of individualistic pleasures. By stripping Western man of his reasons to fight, the enemies of the West have pulled a horrible trick: they have left Western man not only isolated, but also left him lacking the inner convictions and motivations that made Western man such a formidable warrior.</p>
