		<p class="noindent top">The enemies of the West seek to destroy Western man and plunge Western civilisation into a state of madness and degeneracy from which it will never recover. The enemies of the West are 'nation wreckers' that seek to undermine the sovereignty of nations and states in order to make them weak so they can plunder their wealth and enrich themselves through the misery of others. But in order to defeat Western man and reduce Western civilisation to ash, the enemies of the West must first destroy the essence of Western man.</p>
		<p>The Western superego is the essence of Western man and it is this essence that the enemies of the West seek to destroy, for when that essence is extinguished Western man will no longer possess the characteristics that made him great.</p>
		<p>The superego is of course the learned part of the psyche, the morals, the values and the very traditions that are passed down from generation to generation that mould young minds into dependable and upstanding adults. When a group of people share the same traditions and have a shared sense of moral values, they pass down those shared characteristics to their offspring. Everyone in that group grows up surrounded by others who share the same community logic which allows the group to form a community consciousness.</p>
		<p>The Western superego is the embodiment of Western man's community consciousness. The Western superego has been evolving and developing for over 40,000 years since early Western man existed on the edge of Northern Europe's ice sheets and hunted animals that are now long extinct. Western man has passed down his DNA from generation to generation and that has ensured that his physical traits have survived and been strengthened. Western man has also passed down the Western superego through lessons and teachings.</p>
		<p>By passing down learned morality and values from generation to generation, Western man has ensured that it is not only his DNA that lives on in future generations. Western man has ensured that his mentality and ways of thinking live on by passing down his superego to his offspring. This ensures that not only do Western man's physical traits live on, but in a very real way his soul also lives on through future generations.</p>
		<p>Just as the DNA of Western man has changed and evolved over time to favour stronger genetic traits, the Western superego evolved over time to favour stronger morals and values that have acted as the glue that held communities and families together. It became a selective pressure to stick with your own and to be loyal to your family and tribe – this was bred into Western man and reinforced and strengthened through imparting these values again and again to future generations. Over many thousands and thousands of years the Western superego developed and changed and it was not only values that were passed down but also traditions and ways of life.</p>
		<p>As Western man advanced and civilisation grew, so did the Western superego; it was no longer simply a set of binding moral values, but now embodied traditions that stretched back over millennia that became a rich culture. The Western superego consists of the values, morals and traditions of Western man – the very essence of what makes Western man who he is, and the very stuff that binds Western man to his brothers and sisters and creates a community that works as one cohesive group.</p>
		<p>The morals, values and traditions that were passed down from generation to generation slowly evolved into a rich culture that was expressed through language, art, song, dress and architecture. These expressions of Western culture gave rise to a rich heritage that stretches back for millennia and which has left lasting footprints in the sands of time – footprints that show current generations just where their ancestors have come from and the path their ancestors had taken.</p>
		<p>What's more, those footprints in the sands of time not only showed future generations where their ancestors had come from, but they acted as a road map that pointed future generations in the right direction. Those footprints helped mark the way so that as civilisation developed, future generations could see the correct path to take. But importantly a strong community-wide superego not only points out the correct path, but it also causes a community to walk that path together and work as a singular unit. A community or a nation is only strong when the people it consists of work as one and pull together in the same direction.</p>
		<p>When a nation works together as a cohesive group that nation advances and has a far greater chance of warding off threats. But once a nation begins to fracture and divisions appear, the community becomes disparate and is no longer a community but a collection of individuals that no longer relate to one another and as a result begin pulling in different directions. The enemies of the West know this and to conquer Western man they set about attacking the Western superego with the aim of destroying the bonds that hold Western society together.</p>
		<p>We will return to the case of the beehive:</p>

		<p class="noindent top"><b><i>Bees produce honey – and honey is delicious and highly sought after both by man and beast alike. Honey has a high nutrient value and is a wonderful natural food source. But to get honey is no easy feat as the honey is stored deep within the hive and is protected by an entire army of bees. Once the hive is under attack the entire colony will mount an aggressive defence. It would be easy to simply state that the strength of the hive's defence lies merely in the overwhelming number of bees that will emerge to oppose any would-be thieves.</i></b></p>
		<p><b><i>However to simply think that numbers are all that matter is to miss the fundamental issue which is in fact the selfless dedication of the individual to the colony. When a hostile intruder attempts to take the life source of the colony that intruder is met with an overwhelming response, but that overwhelming response comes from many individual bees acting as one.</i></b></p>
		<p><b><i>The unfortunate truth that comes with any defence of the hive is that many individual bees will in fact perish. Bees are unfortunate in that when they attack and sting an enemy, it seals their own fate – every successful sting results in the death of the bee that landed the blow. The bee therefore literally puts the good of the colony before its own life; the bee gives everything in order to ensure the colony survives. The whole defence of the colony is mounted on the pretext of the greater good.</i></b></p>
		<p><b><i>This way of thinking is what has ensured the long-term survival of bees as a species, as it has protected countless colonies and put off many would-be attackers who eyed the honey as a prized meal. What could be more devastating or more painful than to be stung hundreds or thousands of times all over your body? What could be a greater deterrent to those who would happily seek the honey that belongs rightfully to the bees?</i></b></p>
		<p><b><i>A head-on assault would be almost suicidal – or at least very painful. But imagine attacking a hive where each bee thought of itself above the interests of the colony, where each bee was an individual who didn't connect with the other bees that surrounded it. Imagine a beehive where, if an attacker chose to attempt to plunder the honey, the bees thought of themselves before they thought of the colony and either hid in the hive or flew away to ensure their own safety. That hive would be plundered and ultimately the bees would be driven to extinction. If the community consciousness of the hive is destroyed the bees would be done for.</i></b></p>

		<p class="noindent top">It is no different within the world of man. Civilisations and nations only survive when the people who make up those civilisations and nations stick together and work as one in order to repel their enemies and stand strong in the face of adversity. It is the sense of community that holds people together, a sense of the greater good that comes from common bonds. That common bond for Western man is the Western superego. That is why the enemies of the West have set about to attack the Western superego.</p>
		<p>To undermine the will of a nation to work as one group and to prevent individuals working together for the greater good of society is to seal the fate of that nation. If Western man hadn't been so selfless in the defence of his people and his land, if Western man hadn't put the greater good of his nation before himself, the Western world would have ceased to exist a long time ago. It is this community spirit that has seen Western man weather so many storms and triumph again and again even in the face of overwhelming odds.</p>
		<p>The enemies of the West have a strong grasp of history and they are certainly not fools; they know that to defeat Western man it is no good to simply mount a head-on assault on the West. To defeat Western man, first and foremost the essence of Western man must be broken.</p>
		<p>This attack on the Western superego has been carefully orchestrated through numerous means that have been discussed at great length. The aims of these attacks are to prevent the older generation and the younger generation identifying with one another – essentially creating a generation gap. The generation gap prevents the older generation from passing down the superego to the younger generation, and prevents the morals, values and traditions of that society being passed down.</p>
		<p>As this generation gap prevents the passing down of morals, values and traditions, the very culture that was central to Western society begins to fade. Once the young in any society no longer look to their ancestors and no longer seek to follow the footprints previous generations have left in the sand, those generations end up going off track and become lost. A strong culture binds a group of people together and is like the glue that holds society together. When the young no longer follow a strong culture and become lost, they are easy prey for those who wish to lead them further astray.</p>
