		<p class="noindent top">The enemies of the West have sought to undermine Western civilisation by attacking its very foundations. The same devious individuals have also worked to undermine the structures and safeguards that have been erected in order to protect and strengthen Western society. The aim of this wicked scheme is to destroy the Western superego – Western man's highly developed shared mental consciousness.</p>
		<p>By breaking the Western superego the enemies of the West seek to erase Western culture and the traditions and moral values that have been passed down from generation to generation within Western society. Once the culture that binds Western man together as a group and allows those within Western society to relate to one another is dead, Western civilisation shall not long follow it and Western man will face extinction.</p>
		<p>Western man faces losing his mind, body, soul and his once mighty Western heart. Each of these four components is an important part of what made Western man the indomitable titan he once was. In order to break the four components that made Western man such a titan, the enemies of the West had to devise a way of twisting Western man's mind in order to make Western man susceptible to ideas that would otherwise seem insane.</p>
		<p>To convince a people to abandon their partners and families, to convince a people to abandon their communities and culture and to convince females to rebel against their male counterparts would undermine any society. Ultimately these attacks on the West are an attempt to break the Western superego, but such a group of concerted attacks had to be carefully planned and carefully executed. Crucially these attacks had to begin somewhere – but where?</p>
		<p>The attack on Western society began with the attack on the Western mind. The first logical place to strike is the psyche, as once the mind is reduced in its capacity to reason and the hardened mental fortitude of a people is turned to jelly, those people can be convinced of anything. Enslaving people and manipulating them by force whilst keeping them in chains is difficult and requires huge amounts of manpower and resources. To enslave Western man by subjugating him physically and putting him in chains would be unthinkable.</p>
