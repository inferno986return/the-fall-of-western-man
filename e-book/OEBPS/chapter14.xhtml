		<p class="noindent top">The enemies of the West have sought to undermine Western civilisation by attacking its very foundations. The same devious individuals have also worked to undermine the structures and safeguards that have been erected in order to protect and strengthen Western society. The aim of this wicked scheme is to destroy the Western superego – Western man's highly developed shared mental consciousness.</p>
		<p>By breaking the Western superego the enemies of the West seek to erase Western culture and the traditions and moral values that have been passed down from generation to generation within Western society. Once the culture that binds Western man together as a group and allows those within Western society to relate to one another is dead, Western civilisation shall not long follow it and Western man will face extinction.</p>
		<p>Western man faces losing his mind, body, soul and his once mighty Western heart. Each of these four components is an important part of what made Western man the indomitable titan he once was. In order to break the four components that made Western man such a titan, the enemies of the West had to devise a way of twisting Western man's mind in order to make Western man susceptible to ideas that would otherwise seem insane.</p>
		<p>To convince a people to abandon their partners and families, to convince a people to abandon their communities and culture and to convince females to rebel against their male counterparts would undermine any society. Ultimately these attacks on the West are an attempt to break the Western superego, but such a group of concerted attacks had to be carefully planned and carefully executed. Crucially these attacks had to begin somewhere – but where?</p>
		<p>The attack on Western society began with the attack on the Western mind. The first logical place to strike is the psyche, as once the mind is reduced in its capacity to reason and the hardened mental fortitude of a people is turned to jelly, those people can be convinced of anything. Enslaving people and manipulating them by force whilst keeping them in chains is difficult and requires huge amounts of manpower and resources. To enslave Western man by subjugating him physically and putting him in chains would be unthinkable.</p>
		<p>Western man could not have been tamed or defeated by any other race or culture on the planet in a conventional and physical sense. But imagine a situation where the mind of Western man was slowly broken down over time and the chains placed upon him were not physical but mental – where the cage that held him was not one made of iron or steel but was an invisible and intangible form of mental bondage that controlled his mind.</p>
		<p>What could be a more ideal form of slavery than one that does not require chains, guards and constant supervision, but instead the slave is kept in place by his own subservient mental state? But what would make this devious trick even more impressive is if the slave didn't even realise he was a slave and instead thought himself to be free. For a man to believe he was free when in fact he was actually enslaved would be the greatest trick ever pulled. The most powerful cage that can be placed around a man is the illusion that he is in fact free – for when a man believes he is free he would never seek to escape his cage or rebel against his captor.</p>
		<p>What's more, once the mind is enslaved and has a reduced capacity for reason, then thoughts, ideas and notions can easily be implanted in the mind regardless of their merit. Once the mind has been lost the other constituent parts of Western man – the body, soul and heart – could be attacked with ease by means of simply implanting further negative thoughts in the enslaved and impressionable mind.</p>
		<p>Western man did not lose his mind overnight; he wasn't subdued in days, weeks or even years. It took decades of careful manipulation and brainwashing for him to be subdued to the degree he is today. At first Western man's mind was not bombarded with damaging material – at first Western man was drip-fed mental poison and over time those drips became a flow and in greater time that flow became a torrent. The poison fed to Western man was a highly toxic message of false moral values fed to him by the mass media. Over decades the enemies of the West who control the media have manipulated everything Western man has seen, read and heard. The brainwashing process has been slow, but it has been stunningly effective.</p>
		<p>The brainwashing Western man underwent was not administered in an overt way. People were not dragged out of their homes at night and forced into gulags where they were subjected to mental torture against their will. Western man was not chained to walls or tied to tables screaming in agony as his captors beat new ideas into him. Western man was brainwashed in the comfort of his own home, in fact he chose to turn on the device that imparted that brainwashing and he willingly gathered around it with his wife and family. Western man was not coerced; he was not bullied or beaten, and he went willingly to the re-education classes.</p>
		<p>The mass media is firmly in the grasp of the enemies of the West. The film industry, the music industry, the broadcasting media and the press are all under the control of those who wish to see the West fall. These different arms of the media use their respective channels to poison the minds of the Western populace and constantly pump out a torrent of damaging material intent on poisoning the Western mind.</p>
		<p>This is not a new phenomenon; it has not been something that has come about over the last five or ten years, but is a long-standing and developed attack that has been taking place for decades. What's more, this attack has accelerated as the media's power has increased due to technological advancements and the increasingly connected nature of the world.</p>
		<p>The very earliest hit films that were churned out by the devious minds in Hollywood pushed a destructive agenda. First let us go back to 1955 and examine an early film that turned the head of Western man and introduced a rebellious role model to the mind of Western youth with the express intention of fostering a division between father and son and creating a generation gap. This film was <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>.</p>
		<p>The film portrayed a troubled young teenager who couldn't relate to his father and mother and didn't want to follow in their footsteps – instead he chose to rebel against society, society's authority figures and the established way of life. Yet crucially, the rebel was the one without a cause; the rebel didn't fight for noble or worthy reasons, it was simply rebellion for the sake of it. The rebel was not fighting against tyranny or an oppressive and cruel master – but was fighting against a just, fair and decent vision of society.</p>
		<p>The film was set in an era when a strong and cohesive community, a stable two-parent home and a smooth running society were still more or less the norm. <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i> went against all these healthy Western pillars of strength with the portrayal of its main character (the titular rebel), Jim Stark, being an underage drunk who was disrespectful to authority figures and his parents. Jim Stark smoked cigarettes, raced cars, got into knife fights, and would storm out of his parent's house whenever he pleased.</p>
		<p>This kind of behaviour was unheard of at the time – especially in the middle-class setting where the film took place. Jim Stark was not the typical teenager; he was a fantasy figure dreamt up in the minds of devious men who wished to create division within Western society. All of the traits that Jim Stark displayed went against every established ideal of the time – essentially showcasing exactly how a teen should not act. Teens at the time did not act in the way Jim Stark acted and the character was not a portrayal of an ideal or normal teen. So why make a film showing how not to act, how not to behave and portraying a negative role model to millions?</p>
