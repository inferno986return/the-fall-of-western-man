<title>12: Withering Masculinity and the Feminised Male</title>

		<p class="noindent top">As feminism has warped the Western female, turning her from a kind, caring, feminine and motherly woman into a shallow and selfish individual who wishes to emulate her male counterpart, the Western male has undergone his own transformation. The Western male, once the 'alpha', the strong father figure who dispensed order and discipline and was a beacon of authority, has become weak and feminised.</p>
		<p>In a sickening and highly unnatural role reversal, Western man has shed his dominant, strong and manly ways and become feminised, weak and subservient. The strong hunter gatherer, provider, protector and guardian has withered, becoming emotionally driven and unstable due to a mixture of lamentable role models, a weakened role in society and an increasingly purposeless existence.</p>
		<p>In his new role, the Western male adopts everything his forefathers would have once scorned. He becomes reclusive from other males, he dresses and presents himself in ways that are more akin to that of a female and finds himself increasingly unable to live up to his natural role as the 'alpha'. There are many reasons why the Western male has declined in such a way and they are a direct product of the sustained attack on the Western superego.</p>
		<p>The enemies of the West have sought to undermine both the family unit and its individual constituent parts – the male and female. The enemies of the West have sought to subvert the natural order of life by reversing the role of the male and female – something that has weakened the West.</p>
		<p>The breakdown of the family unit is the first and most obvious cause of the emasculation of males within Western society. The family unit is the cornerstone of Western society and a fully functional family unit is composed of a loving mother and strong father figure. Both the mother and the father have important roles in the development of a young child and both serve as role models to the child in different ways.</p>
		<p>In early infancy both children spend nearly their entire waking day with their mother. This early part of human development is where 'attachment' takes place and the close bond between mother and child speeds the mental and physical development of the child. Children who have a stronger bond with their mother through their early development become more mentally advanced.</p>
		<p>As time goes by and the child grows up, the amount of time the child spends with its mother will change. Young females will tend to continue to spend more time with their mothers, whilst young males would typically spend more time with their fathers.</p>
		<p>This helps the child to develop their natural gender roles. As the authority figure and disciplinarian in the family, the father would have a crucial role in imparting the superego – the learned part of the psyche – to his son. An upstanding and strong father becomes an important role model to his son and helps the young male form an image of his 'ideal self' which as the young man grows and develops he strives toward.</p>
		<p>The Western family unit has been under repeated attack from the likes of feminism, a relaxation in social attitudes toward both marriage and single parent families, and through a relaxation of the laws surrounding divorce. It is now more and more common to see single parent families where a father figure is not present in the household. This removes the disciplinarian from the home and leaves young males without a strong father figure who would serve as their primary male role model and source of inspiration for their ideal self.</p>
		<p>The young male would naturally spend more and more time with his father as he grew up, developing his masculinity and learning how to become a man. In a world where there are an increasing number of broken homes, resulting in an increasing number of children who lack contact with their fathers, many young males now grow up without the influence of their father. In essence, this strips the young male of his primary male role model.</p>
