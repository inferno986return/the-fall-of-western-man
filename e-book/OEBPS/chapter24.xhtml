<title>24: True Salvation – Nationalism</title>

		<p class="noindent top">The only true salvation for Western man is nationalism. Western man must return to his roots and embrace what once made him great. Western man must take on an ideology that encourages him to reconnect with his brothers and sisters and that allows him to rebuild his shattered communities. This ideology must reconnect Western man not only with his kin – but must also reconnect him with the land and soil that has been his home for thousands of years. Blood and soil are the natural callings that must be at the centre of Western man's mindset.</p>
		<p>But Western man must do more than simply strive to reconnect with blood and soil – Western man must also strive for excellence. This drive for excellence must start with the individual, but it must not be for individual glory, instead this drive for excellence must be for a greater good. Western man must strive for excellence in order to become a beacon of hope around which others can cluster, a beacon that attracts others who wish to embrace a healthier way of life. In this way, Western man can begin to rebuild his fractured communities and create something better.</p>
		<p>Western man must improve himself and hold his hand out to his brothers and sisters and aim to improve their lives also. Western man must work to tear down the barriers that have been erected in order to separate him from his kin and break up his once cohesive communities. Western man must rise up and embrace the single ideology that embodies all these virtues – nationalism. Western man must stand against both capitalism and communism and overcome social divisions to create a homogeneous society, and at the heart of this society must be tradition, culture and heritage.</p>
		<p>The first and central tenet of nationalism is love for one's own race – genuine nationalism is not an ideology of hate for others, but a love for and devotion to one's own people and culture.</p>

		<p class="top center"><b><i>To love one's own people and to respect all others who wish to do the same.</i></b></p>

		<p class="noindent top">Nationalism wishes for Western man to embrace his own blood and rebuild the Western community. To be at peace with the world, a man must love himself and his own family and community – to hate your own people and to be riddled with false guilt will never lead to happiness or fulfilment. Nationalism is an ideology that elevates one's own people above all others and places the protection and love of those people above all other concerns.</p>
		<p>Hatred for other people or races who also wish to follow a path of nationalism is wholly counterproductive. If Africans, Asians or any other ethnicity for that matter wish to embrace their own people and culture and strive for self-determination, then they should be applauded for doing so. The world is a magnificent place and is made up of an intricate tapestry of different cultures, races and ethnicities – and should remain that way.</p>

		<p class="top center"><b><i>Every race and culture should have the right to self-determination and self-governance.</i></b></p>

		<p class="noindent top">No race or ethnicity should seek to dominate another: let the African be an African, let the Asian be an Asian – but equally let Western man be what he should be. Every race or culture should have the right to determine their own future and the direction their people take without interference or coercion from another. The world is a richer place for the existence of different cultures and ways of life – and it should remain so. Different people should not be forced to live together in one big melting pot which will inevitably lead to conflict and the loss of unique ways of life that have been evolving and developing for thousands of years.</p>
		<p>Whilst different races and cultures cannot live in one confined space, there is enough room on this planet for everyone and everyone should have their own place.</p>

		<p class="top center"><b><i>All peoples of the world have the right to a homeland and the right to defend that homeland.</i></b></p>

		<p class="noindent top">Western man has the right to the lands that gave birth to him, the lands that he has tended for thousands of years and the lands that have sheltered generations of his family – those lands are his birthright. Equally, all races of the world have the right to their own homelands too, and they have the right to live in those homelands in peace, free of interference from others. Every race has the right to defend their homeland against an aggressor that seeks to displace them or dominate them by either force or guile.</p>
		<p>As such, every race and every nation has the right to control its own borders and limit immigration as they see fit. No nation is under any obligation to allow other cultures, races or ethnicities to cross their borders and settle within their lands. Ultimately the rich tapestry of the world will only ever be retained if different cultures maintain the traditions that define them. As such, different cultures can learn from and trade with each other, but should never live within each other's borders on a scale that alters the racial or cultural make-up of the host nation.</p>

		<p class="top center"><b><i>People are a product of the land they come from and should respect and honour that land.</i></b></p>

		<p class="noindent top">All peoples of the world have developed almost independently and often in vastly different environments. These different environments – nature itself – have moulded different people in different ways and given each race distinct characteristics. Not only should those characteristics be preserved and that diversity praised, but the environment that created those different races should be respected and honoured.</p>
		<p>Despite the advancement of technology, Western man should not become a stranger to the land that shaped and moulded him and sheltered and provided for countless generations of his ancestors. Western man should reconnect with the natural world and strive to be as close to nature as possible and aim to live in harmony with the natural environment. To believe humanity is above nature is a dangerous fallacy – humanity still depends on the natural world and ultimately the natural world depends on humanity.</p>
		<p>Western man should not pollute his lands nor should he treat his environment with disrespect or contempt. Western man should strive to show kindness to animals and compassion to those creatures that have less power than he – for nothing says more about a man than how he treats those less powerful than himself. Western man may be at the top of the food chain, but that does not give him the right to abuse that power or to inflict undue suffering upon the creatures that lie beneath him in that chain. The balance of the natural environment can be a delicate thing; it is best not to upset that balance, and man should strive to live as closely in harmony with nature as possible.</p>

		<p class="top center"><b><i>People should live in harmony with their natural environment and show kindness and respect to all living creatures.</i></b></p>

		<p class="noindent top">A healthy and vibrant natural world and a connection with that world is food for the soul. Those who cut themselves off from nature and cocoon themselves in concrete separate themselves from their environment and disconnect themselves from the very world that gives them life. This leads to both a mentally and a physically unhealthy state – neither of which are conducive to a strong nation.</p>

		<p class="top center"><b><i>A nation's health lies in the health of its people – strong people build a strong nation.</i></b></p>

		<p class="noindent top">A nation is only as healthy as the people who make up that nation. A nation full of slobs, drunkards and substance abusers will never be strong. A nation has the right to defend itself, but that nation must also have the ability to defend itself. A man can only defend his nation when he is strong and healthy. If Western man wishes to defend the soil that he calls home, then he must reject the poisons that ravage his body and strive for both physical and mental health.</p>
		<p>Only through physical and mental health can individuals feel truly good about themselves. When people allow themselves to stagnate, they slip into a malaise which drags them down further and traps them in a negative cycle which spirals ever downward and carries them to self-defeat. Young and old alike should be encouraged to take up healthy pastimes in natural environments and embrace the natural highs that these pastimes provide.</p>
