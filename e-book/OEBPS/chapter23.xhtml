		<p class="noindent top">National Socialism is an ideology of discipline and order that seeks to establish a perfect homogenous society that is centred on national unity. As such National Socialism scorns social divisions and selfish individualism. National Socialism is an ideology that strives for excellence and pushes individuals within society to better themselves – not just for the sake of individual greatness but instead to improve society as a whole.</p>
		<p>Discipline, order and excellence made National Socialism one of the few true threats to the enemies of the West – so what better way to undermine National Socialism than to take its symbols and banners and wrap them around a degenerate musical subculture? The enemies of the West fear the power of National Socialism, and know that in its true and pure form it is a uniting force that could drive the enemies of the West from Western shores and free Western man.</p>
		<p>The enemies of the West have sought to attack National Socialism and undermine it. The enemies of the West have used their power in the media and the press to 'rebrand' National Socialism in the most degenerate and debased way possible. The enemies of the West have sought to turn National Socialism on its head and ensure that instead of discipline, order and excellence, National Socialism stands for the opposite of these things – chaos, degeneracy and weakness.</p>
		<p>The enemies of the West have created what is known as the 'Hollywood Nazi', otherwise known as the skinhead. The Hollywood Nazi is anything but a National Socialist. The Hollywood Nazi may well emblazon National Socialist symbols on his clothes; he may well stand in front banners that bear those symbols, and he may also espouse his wish to save Western man, but the Hollywood Nazi is a twisted vision of genuine National Socialism. Hollywood Nazism and the skinhead music scene that accompanies it have become a beacon for defectives and misfits who are attracted to being part of an 'outsider gang' that has a reputation for being anti-social.</p>
		<p>The Hollywood Nazi was created by the same twisted minds that gave the Western world Lady Gaga and <i>Rebel Without a Cause.</i> The enemies of the West created the Hollywood Nazi subculture and propagated their creation through the media by producing films such as <i>Romper Stomper</i> and <i>American History X</i>. These films attempt to redefine National Socialism along lines that are beneficial to the enemies of the West. These films also attempt to associate racial and cultural consciousness with negatives that are intended to drive normal people away from having anything to do with any form of nationalism.</p>
		<p>The films that promote the Hollywood Nazi are made by the enemies of the West in order to appeal to lost and self-destructive youngsters. These films seek to push negative role models and a destructive subculture upon young Western minds in a similar manner to films like <i>Kids</i> and <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>. What makes the Hollywood Nazi subculture unique is that it has a second objective – it seeks to present nationalism as both unappealing and toxic. The Hollywood Nazi subculture is unique as it is used to scare the public away from nationalism.</p>
		<p>Young people who choose to rebel against their parents and society by adopting the skinhead subculture strive to conform to the image of the Hollywood Nazi. This begins a self-fulfilling cycle which serves the aims of the enemies of the West. Young people see films like <i>Romper Stomper</i>, and then seek to emulate the characters in those films. Then the media film real life documentaries based on violent skinhead gangs who attempt to replicate the behaviour, dress and attitudes of characters they saw in films. These gangs are filmed drinking, being anti-social, engaging in acts of violence and attacking immigrants all in the name of nationalism. This is the way the enemies of the West have turned their twisted fantasy of nationalism into a damaging reality.</p>
		<p>The first important thing to discuss when analysing this false salvation is to compare the Hollywood Nazi with genuine National Socialism. To do this let us first take a look at one of the defining moments in National Socialist history – the Nuremberg Rallies. The Nuremberg Rallies were the annual party rallies held by the NSDAP (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei – National Socialist German Workers' Party) between 1923 and 1938. Arguably the most famous of these rallies occurred in 1934 and was the subject of the film the <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, directed and produced by Leni Riefenstahl. In 1934 over 700,000 National Socialists attended the Nuremburg rally – a true spectacle for the world to behold.</p>
		<p>The Nuremberg Rallies centred on political speeches and large orderly parades – discipline and order were central to the entire event, and the musical accompaniment was classical orchestral overtures. The sight of hundreds of thousands of men lined up in perfect order, listening to speeches made under huge banners, was a sight to behold, and something that one would have been proud to be a part of. Those in attendance wore uniforms, looked healthy and were of good breeding stock. Everyone in attendance looked alike and were clearly part of one cohesive group.</p>
		<p>Compare the Nuremberg Rallies with the kind of events held by modern Hollywood Nazis or skinheads. Skinhead events consist of a few hundred people gathered in a small hall, drinking, smoking, pushing one another and listening to raucous music. In fact the modern skinhead event couldn't be much further from the Nuremburg Rallies in either intent or execution. The whole ethos behind these skinhead events has nothing whatsoever to do with order or discipline and in fact is centred on chaos. There are no orderly speeches, parades or shows of strength and those in attendance are neither uniformed nor smart in their appearance.</p>
		<p>Obese men covered with tattoos lurch back and forth in a drunken manner as they listen to music which clearly has more in common with the degenerate subcultures pushed by the enemies of the West than it does with anything healthy or classical. There is no culture and no spectacle – in fact if one changed the lyrics of the music and removed the banners at the back of the stage these events could belong to any musical subculture. In fact without the lyrics and banners those in attendance could be mistaken for punks, goths or rockers and seen as just another group of misled individuals attached to a subculture manufactured by the enemies of the West.</p>
		<p>These skinhead events are based on exactly the same kind of hedonism, degeneracy and individualism as other musical events and subcultures created by the enemies of the West. These events are not spectacles of excellence attended by fit, healthy and clean-living men that would hold the world in awe. These events are spectacles of degeneracy which would actually appal most normal people and dissuade them from joining any form of nationalist movement.</p>
		<p>Whereas the Nuremburg Rallies and the film <i>Triumph of the Will</i> united a nation behind a common cause and showed the world what could be achieved by a homogenous, organised and disciplined organisation, skinhead concerts do the opposite. If taken to their logical extreme these skinhead events would be no different to the hedonistic festivals where young people drink excessively, use drugs and behave wildly for a weekend – a far cry from what Western man should be aiming for.</p>
		<p>If one looks back to what was put forward as a perfect society, an analogy was drawn with a colony of bees. This analogy illustrated order, discipline and an entire community moving in unison toward one goal. The Nuremburg Rallies were the human embodiment of that perfect society and a showcase of that order – hundreds of thousands of men in uniform who looked the same, moving in unison and order as a display of power and discipline. Compare that with a skinhead concert, where drunken individuals wearing customised clothing and exhibiting outlandish body modifications and tattoos move in a chaotic fashion as they jump around aimlessly. These two events are literally polar opposites – yet the enemies of the West have tried to link them and pass them off as one and the same!</p>
		<p>This analysis will surely cause raised eyebrows – after all those attending these events allegedly subscribe to the higher ideals of nationalism and would happily describe themselves as National Socialists. However actions speak louder than words. To be a National Socialist is not merely to raise a flag or pay lip service to certain facets of an ideology. To be a National Socialist is to live a clean and healthy lifestyle and aim to be the best you can be – physically, mentally and spiritually. To be a National Socialist is to be ordered, disciplined and strong and uphold the values and traditions of the West.</p>
		<p>Most importantly, National Socialism promotes the notion that one should strive to be the best one can be; it promotes self-improvement and the pursuit of a healthy ideal self. To follow the skinhead way is to do the very opposite of this and to embrace the very things the enemies of the West have used in order to destroy Western man and break apart Western communities.</p>
		<p>By creating a degenerate musical subculture and attaching it to National Socialism (thus creating the Hollywood Nazi), the enemies of the West have made this corrupted version of National Socialism a magnet for defectives. Often those who are attracted to the skinhead scene are lost individuals who cannot function in society and are seeking to be part of a group of other anti-social misfits. These people are not captains of industry, great athletes, inventors or other inspirational individuals, but often the opposite.</p>
		<p>The Hollywood Nazi subculture is designed to scoop up these defectives. Take the film <i>Romper Stomper</i>: the skinheads in that film live like animals in an abandoned warehouse. They are essentially squatters who do not work, do not pay rent, and do not provide anything productive to society. Minus the flags, banners and patches they would be seen as common or garden delinquents and undesirables. What kind of person would be drawn to that lifestyle – certainly not the people required to mount a serious fightback in order to save the West.</p>
		<p>Not only do the people who flock to this scene provide little or no benefit to the wider nationalist cause, they are in fact poisonous to the greater good and inhibit the growth of nationalism. These defectives alienate nationalism from the very people it needs to attract if it is ever to grow and become a genuine alternative. Why would a man who owns a successful business wish to join a group of homeless bums who squat in a warehouse and drink until 4am every morning? Why would a loving mother and good housekeeper want to associate herself with a gang whose idea of political activity is spray-painting obscenities on toilet walls?</p>
		<p>The healthy and normal people that nationalism needs to attract in order to grow and prosper want nothing to do with anti-social yobs or gangs. By wrapping up National Socialism in such negatives, the enemies of the West have actually pulled a very clever trick – they have ensured that normal and productive people will never again be drawn towards a genuine alternative to their poison.</p>
		<p>Take for example a Western family who feel threatened by the loss of their culture, by the growing level of non-Western immigration into their town and who dislike the degeneracy that is pushed upon their children. When they look at alternatives to the current political system they want something that is a genuine alternative – something that presents a viable solution to the problems they face. The people who see gang culture as a growing problem within their towns and cities are hardly going to join a gang themselves. In fact they want the opposite of a gang: they want a strong and healthy community-based group that embodies the values they hold dear.</p>
