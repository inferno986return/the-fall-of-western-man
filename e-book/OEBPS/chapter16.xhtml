		<p class="noindent top">The existence of the soul is something that has been long debated by religious scholars, philosophers and scientists. Does the soul exist and what does its existence signify? In a very real sense, the soul is a deeper level of consciousness that lies at the very core of our being. It is that special extra 'something' that sets us apart from other creatures in the animal kingdom. The soul is the spiritual or immaterial part of a human being.</p>
		<p>The soul is often seen as immortal, something that transcends life and death and lives on for eternity. The idea of the soul has been with us from the beginning of recorded time and probably existed long before that. Whilst in many ways the soul can be seen as intangible, it is often seen as the 'breath of life' that animates the body – in effect the very essence of the human being.</p>
		<p>The soul is separate and distinct from the body and the mind. You can feed and satisfy your body through food and physical activity. You can satisfy your mind through knowledge and discovery. But to satisfy the soul, that is a deeper and altogether more complex affair. To satisfy the soul is in many ways more important than either physical or mental satisfaction, as a satisfied soul leads to one being at peace with both himself and the world around him.</p>
		<p>Once the soul is at ease and satisfied other stresses and pains seem less significant. The importance of achieving spiritual satisfaction is in many ways more important than simply satisfying the mind and body. An individual that endlessly seeks spiritual satisfaction but never finds it ends up feeling spiritually restless which can lead to a tortured existence. An individual who finds the search for inner peace to be elusive would live a truly cursed existence.</p>
		<p>If an individual has a restless soul and constantly searches for inner peace, that quest will hamper the individual's ability to achieve other goals. For a man cannot be at ease with his surroundings, his peers and most crucially not even be at ease with himself when he harbours a restless soul. Logically, when a man is not at ease with himself, he can never be truly free or happy. What's more, when an individual's soul is not at ease all the other problems that individual faces seem magnified.</p>
		<p>The soul is a higher form of consciousness and thus not directly observable which in turn makes it hard to study in a scientific way. The soul is not something we can see, measure or directly quantify or catalogue – in these ways the soul is very much like the superego. As we know what causes the superego to develop, we can assess the influences that feed the soul and provide spiritual nourishment.</p>
		<p>Broadly speaking there are three different spiritual bonds that serve to feed the soul and satisfy spiritual needs. The more these bonds are strengthened and the more the soul is satisfied, the more at ease one becomes with both himself and the world around him. A happy and spiritually fulfilled individual has the foundations for success in life, as positive mental and physical growth are much more likely to occur in individuals that are at peace with themselves.</p>
		<p>The first and most fundamental spiritual bond that feeds the soul is the bond that an individual shares with their immediate family, loved ones and with members of the community in which they live. This bond comes from human interaction with loved ones, the people that you hold the most dear and those you identify most strongly with. This most fundamental spiritual need springs forth from the nuclear family and its roots lie in the development of the family bonds that Western man began to form and develop during the earliest days of Western society.</p>
		<p>As males and females form complementary pairs that eventually become more than the sum of their constituent parts, a major part of spiritual fulfilment comes from finding a life partner. As stated before, the bonds we form with our life partners are based on more than simple attraction, sexual chemistry and the desire to procreate. Humans develop a powerful emotion which acts as a bond for life between two loving partners – that emotion is love.</p>
