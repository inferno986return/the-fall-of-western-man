		<p class="noindent top">Western man is a titan and his great achievements and the civilisation he created once held the world in awe. But none of those achievements nor the great civilisation Western man built would have been possible without Western man working together with his brothers and sisters and forming communities, tribes and nations which pulled together for the greater good and which became more than the sum of their individual parts.</p>
		<p>Western man changed the world and virtually every single world-altering invention or discovery came from his fertile mind and was developed, industrialised and put into practice by his hand. None of this would have been possible without Western society pulling together and working as one in order to turn great thoughts and plans into great realities.</p>
		<p>Take as an example the great works of architecture that fill Western cities. Some of these wonders such as the Colosseum in Rome were built thousands of years ago – yet they are still a cause for inspiration and wonderment even today. It is true that the plans for these great structures were often the visions and designs of an individual architect or a small group of talented designers. However the reason the architects and designers realised their plans is because the cohesive society that surrounded them pulled together in order to turn their plans into magnificent realities.</p>
		<p>Just like a colony of bees, when humans come together and form a community that can be likened to a single living and breathing entity, with its own shared consciousness, then what can be achieved is almost limitless and infinitely greater than what can be achieved by mere individuals. The enemies of the West know this – and that is why they have done everything they can to undermine Western society in the numerous ways that have been explained in detail over the course of this book.</p>
		<p>The enemies of Western man have used every devious trick they could think of in order to promote the importance of being an individual. They push the notion that individualism should be held up as the highest and most noble virtue. These people scorn the idea of the need for a set of societal standards which allow people to identify with one another and come together as a cohesive community. In fact individualism has become like a cult within Western society. Western man now competes with his brothers and sisters in order to emphasise his own individuality and prove how different he is from those around him.</p>
		<p>The cult of individualism affects every aspect of Western life – from the way people dress to the way they style their hair and present themselves. Over time individuals have taken increasingly extreme steps in order to ensure they are truly one of a kind. People now modify their own bodies in ever more outlandish ways in an effort to stand out from the crowd. But the embrace of individualism has a hugely adverse effect on Western society causing it to become less homogenous – rather than a cohesive community, Western society becomes a loose collection of individuals who no longer relate to one another.</p>
		<p>Let us now return to the analogy of the bees.</p>

		<p class="noindent top"><b><i>The beehive works because the bees that inhabit the hive are a homogenous group and form a colony. The bees not only look alike but they think alike. The bees have a shared consciousness and work together in harmony for the good of the colony. The bees do not put the good of the individual before the good of the colony, as fundamentally when the good of the colony comes first the colony becomes strong and healthy, and a strong and healthy colony shelters and protects the individual bees. The individual bee does not reason like a human, but on an instinctive and primeval level the bee knows that his individual well-being is tied to the well-being of the colony. Now imagine what would happen to the colony if each and every bee decided to go it alone and push for its own individuality and personal freedoms and put those before the good of the colony. The bees would no longer wish to dance in the same manner; they would no longer be able to communicate effectively with each other and they would become increasingly isolated from one another. As the colony inevitably broke up, the hive itself would crumble and everything the bees had built and strived for would be lost.</i></b></p>

		<p class="noindent top">Again this analogy may seem simplistic but it illustrates an important point and one that can be directly applied to Western nations. The West was at its strongest when its community was at its most cohesive – and the enemies of Western man know this. That is why once the structures and safeguards that held the West together were weakened, the enemies of the West put into place the final and most devastating part of their plan; to ensure not only the break-up of Western society, but that Western society can never be put back together again.</p>
		<p>It is one thing to break up a community – but that process can often be reversed. Times of struggle and hardship can pull a group of people together and cause them to work as one again, forcing them to rediscover common bonds and reunite as a community. However if the individuals that once made up that community had become so different and so disparate that they could no longer relate to one another, then even in times of hardship they would be unable to reunite and work as a cohesive group.</p>
		<p>What would make all of this worse is if the people that made up that community no longer interacted with one another or spent time together – instead choosing solitary pursuits which increased their sense of isolation. Imagine if people just sat in front of their television or their computer spending hours watching programmes, playing games and browsing social networks. Not only would the people who made up that once strong community be unable to relate to one another due to their embrace of individualism, but they would no longer have the social skills necessary to interact with one another due to their increasingly solitary and isolated lifestyle.</p>
