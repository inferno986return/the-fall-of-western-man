		<p class="noindent top">The nuclear family is the cornerstone of Western society; it is central to the Western way of life. The family bond originated out of evolutionary pressure; Western man was forced into lasting partnerships in order to both defend and raise his children. Individuals who decided to give up on their partners inevitably saw their offspring perish and their genetic lines erased, however those couples who stuck together and worked as a family unit to ensure the survival of their offspring saw their children survive and mature and their genetic line carried on.</p>
		<p>The coming together of man and woman was then enshrined in religious and state law. As individuals grouped together as tribes and tribes became nations, state and religious law sought to sanctify marriage and set the couple and the nuclear family above all else – a bond for life and one that should not be broken lightly. The importance of this family unit has been discussed extensively in the context of the significance of a two-parent family and the effect of both a mother and father being present when raising children.</p>
		<p>We have discussed the importance of the strong father and the loving mother in the upbringing of children and how a two-parent family is crucial to the successful mental development of the child and most importantly in imparting the superego to the next generation. We have also discussed how in the West, the once strong family unit is now under attack, how divorce is on the rise and how children are increasingly being brought up in single parent homes. The effect of the loss of a strong father figure and disciplinarian in the home is quite clear to see.</p>
		<p>It has also been discussed that the weakening of the superego has allowed the id to run free which has led to a rise in the number of divorces as both men and women choose to shirk the moral duties of bringing up their children as a couple, instead choosing to pursue a selfish path of individualism and pleasure. Along with the drive for individualism and pleasure, the enemies of the West have also mounted other attacks on the family unit, one of them being feminism.</p>
		<p>Feminism operates under the guise of equality – that man and woman should be equal, when in fact men and women are not equal but different. Men and women make up a complementary pair and when together form a unit that is more than the sum of its parts. A happy home is supported by both a mother and a father, but the input of the father and the input of the mother are both markedly different, yet equally important.</p>
		<p>Feminism sets up a dichotomy where men and women are natural enemies – it attacks the natural order of society and seeks to create a war between the sexes. Feminists seek to create a false battle where women need to overcome and dominate the males around them. Feminism is not a progressive movement that seeks to free women, but a divisive ideology that wishes to separate men and women from their natural roles as partners and instead seeks to set them against one another.</p>
		<p>Make no mistake, feminism is an ideology of hate – hate for natural, strong masculine males, but also hate for the natural loving and feminine female. It is an ideology that seeks not equality, but for the female to dominate the male on his own grounds. It is an ideology that wishes to transform the female from being a natural, loving and compassionate individual into little more than a poor substitute for a man. Feminism seeks to break down natural boundaries and turn natural gender roles on their head. However these natural boundaries and gender roles are some of the founding blocks that served to build Western civilisation.</p>
		<p>The drive for feminism within the West has had profound effects – not only does it lead to the death of the loving mother, but it also increasingly leads to the destruction of the family unit. How can man and woman come together as a complementary pair, as lovers, friends and partners, when they are being set against each other as if they were natural enemies? The whole overarching thought process behind feminism sets men up as the natural enemy and oppressor of the female – and who in their right mind would choose to settle and form a lifelong bond with their enemy and oppressor?</p>
		<p>The whole basis of modern feminism is built around one central belief – that society is one big 'patriarchy' – a social system where men have the upper hand and control the running of society, to the detriment of females who are subservient to the authority of the male, and are in effect little more than slaves to their male counterparts.</p>
		<p>In the feminist's thought process it logically follows that if the woman is oppressed by the male, if she is nothing more than his slave and marriage is just a way of state and religious law ratifying that slavery for life, then women should reject marriage.</p>
		<p>Following this rather radical line of thought is the even more extreme idea that we live in a world where 'rape culture' is prevalent. In feminist theory, rape culture is a concept in which rape is pervasive and normalised in the West due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality. In essence, rape culture is the bizarre theory that all men are potential rapists and rape is something men see as healthy. The theory of rape culture also states that men use rape as a tool to exert control and power over females within society.</p>
		<p>This bizarre set of beliefs would be laughable – if they weren't so dangerous and weren't influencing the minds of so many young women in Western society. Once young women buy into this warped theory, it is little or no wonder that the family unit becomes the first and most obvious casualty. The notion that women are essentially slaves to men, held in servitude by the threat of rape no less, is hardly a notion that is going to endear women to men.</p>
		<p>Now extrapolate that idea – women are told that they are slaves and they live under the constant threat of rape which is used as a tool to control them by their slave masters. Their slave masters are of course men who are all part of an overarching patriarchy that seeks to exert control over all women. How could any woman who believes this nonsense ever engage in a healthy, trusting and loving relationship with a man?</p>
		<p>This very notion is one that could not be more divisive to the family unit. The coming together of man and woman is vital to the survival of any racial or cultural group – but if the men and women who made up a particular group were set against one another and made to resent each other the chances of that group surviving would diminish rapidly. Those who are propagating these feminist ideals are propagating an attack on Western society which is wholly destructive and divisive – they are literally attacking the cornerstone of Western civilisation by setting the two constituent parts of the family unit against one another.</p>
		<p>Before these points are advanced any further, let us take a close look at the underlying thought process and 'facts' behind terms like 'patriarchy' and 'rape culture'. Firstly, it goes without saying that men do hold a disproportionate power in the structures that have emerged and developed in Western society – however it does not follow that such power is either oppressive nor does it follow that men are more important or that men exist on a higher level than females.</p>
		<p>Males do take leadership roles within society more readily than females – however that is because the male is naturally the disciplinarian who imparts order, a trait important to any successful leader. This of course does not make the female obsolete or less important than her male counterpart as feminists would like to claim. The role of the female is that of a loving mother and partner who nurtures, cares for and oversees the early mental development and growth of her children. The future of any society or nation lies within its youth and what role could be more important to a well-functioning society than ensuring the development of the next generation?</p>
		<p>The female's role is not solely in childrearing; the female also plays an important role in supporting her male counterpart. This support and love is something that allows men to achieve more than they could on their own and in turn allows greater advancements within society – as such it is commonly said that behind every great man is a strong woman. Whilst men who enjoy the support and love of a good woman are more likely to emerge as authority figures and take leadership roles in society, men also serve as protectors and guardians to the females who support them. Support is not a one-way street and men and women have always supported each other in different ways as they both complement one another.</p>
		<p>The feminist however does not acknowledge this. The feminist wishes to create a conflict between man and woman, with the male being painted as the oppressive slave master who wishes to keep the female down and the female being presented as the oppressed victim who needs to break free and regain her independence. But under quite simple examination the idea that the male seeks to turn the female into a slave falls apart.</p>
		<p>Crucially, no slave master would ever put their life before that of his slaves in order to protect what was mere property to him. Slaves are merely a commodity, something that is measured in monetary worth and can be used as a medium of exchange. No master loves his slaves; he works them to their limit and sees them simply as a tool in the same way he would see a piece of machinery.</p>
		<p>Yet millions of Western men have given their lives wading through the mud of foreign fields and blood of their comrades and enemies as they fought to protect the lives and liberty of their wives and children. A man who is willing to give his life for another person must view that person in nothing but the highest regard – and the highest regard is what Western civilisation has always had for the Western female.</p>
		<p>In times of war or hardship it would not be unreasonable to think that a slave master might put his slaves on the front line, to use them as cannon fodder and expend their lives to ensure his own safety. The Western male has never done this; when war has broken out the woman has always stayed at home, safe from the dangers and hardships of battle as the man has gone to fight in order to protect her liberty. But when did the slave master ever risk his life in order to protect the liberty of his slaves?</p>
		<p>In times of disaster it was always women and children first – men would happily go down with the ship and give their own lives so that women and children would be afforded safety. It is doubtful any slave master would choose to fill the lifeboats with their slaves and go down with the ship to ensure the safety of their property above themselves.</p>
		<p>The feminist however will eagerly tell you that staying in the home was never a luxury for the female and that the home certainly wasn't a safe space. The feminist will tell you that the homemaker was not free, nor did she have her liberty – the feminist will try to tell you that the home was a prison. The feminist will attempt to claim the homemaker was essentially tied to the home as a prisoner to a cage, whilst the man was free to go and work and carve out a lucrative career in the freedom of the outside world.</p>
		<p>It is true that women did stay at home; they did look after the children and they did support their men as homemakers. But whilst women were at home, the men went out on fishing boats braving the wild seas; they went down mine shafts and risked being crushed to death or being asphyxiated by poison gas. Men also enlisted for military duty to protect their settlements from raiders and rival tribes – literally risking their lives on a daily basis.</p>
		<p>The woman may well have stayed in the home and acted as a mother and homemaker – but she did not remain in the home as a slave who missed out on the wonders that her male counterpart enjoyed. The woman may rarely have risen to the level of tribal leader, but neither did she face death on a daily basis from simply doing her job, nor did she march to war to be hacked to pieces on a cold foreign field.</p>
